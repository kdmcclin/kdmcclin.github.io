      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="unit1_projects/images/me.jpg" alt="Picture of Me">
      <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
      <p>I'm a lifelong resident of Washington, DC (hence the header photo I took of the Jefferson Memorial).  Yes I was born here, and no, neither of my parents are politicians or work for the government.</p>
      <h3>Becoming a Developer</h3>
      <p>My career background, brief though it has been, is in education and the humanities.  I received my Master's in Secondary Education (Social Studies) in the summer of 2013, but the lack of career options and a lifelong interest in and aptitude for technology has lead me to Dev Bootcamp.</p>
      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <p>I was a fencer in my undergraduate years, but due to an injury and lack of time to devote to it I haven't fenced much lately.  Luckily fencing is easy to pursue at any stage of life.</p>
      <img src="unit1_projects/images/fencing1.png" alt="Fencing Bout">
      <p>The reason why it's so hard to find images of myself to use is that I'm usually the one taking the pictures.  Another hobby of mine is photography.  I took the following photo on a trip to Nova Scotia in the summer of 2011 and it's one of my favorites.</p>

      <p>I also love music.  Singing it, listening to it, playing it--I like it all. Unfortunately I don't know how to play too many musical instruments (or at least how to play them well). I'm fourth from the left in the top row of the following picture.</p>

      <h3>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</h3>
      <p>That's about all for now, but feel free to contact me through the icons in my footer.  The easiest way to get in touch with me is probably through my e-mail: <a href="mailto:kdmcclin@gmail.com?Subject=Hello" target="_top">kdmcclin@gmail.com</a>.</p>
