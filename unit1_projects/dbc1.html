		<p>This is a picture of the Jefferson Memorial that I took from the top of the Washington Monument a few years ago.  An earthquake closed the Washington Monument for a few years but it has recently re-opened.  Perhaps surprisingly, I have only been up it <i>once</i> and that was only because a friend was visiting from England.</p>

			Don't interrupt me during a <a href="http://www.nationals.com/">Nats</a> game, it won't be pretty. :)</p>
		<p><b>Music</b><br>
			<img src="images/choirpic.jpg" alt="Choir Picture">
			<p>Singing to it, listening to it, playing it--I like it all.  Unfortunately I don't know how to play too many musical instruments (or at least how to play them well).  I'm fourth from the left in the top row of the above picture.</p>
		<p><b>Travelling</b><br>
			<img src="images/whalens.png" alt="A Whale in the Ocean">
			<p>I don't get to travel very much, but I love to do it.  I took the above picture of a minke whale in Nova Scotia, off the coast of Cape Breton near Pleasant Bay.  A few places that I really want to visit are: New Orleans, Croatia, and San Francisco.</p>
