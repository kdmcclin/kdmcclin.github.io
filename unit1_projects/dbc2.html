				<h2>Where is Nova Scotia?</h2>
				<p>Nova Scotia is one of the four Canadian provinces on the Atlantic Ocean.  It is comprised of a peninsula (the Nova Scotia mainland) and several islands, including the large Cape Breton Island just northeast of the mainland.  Nova Scotia's southern end is on the same line of latitude as parts of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont (among other states).</p>

				<h2>A (Very) Quick History of the Area</h2>
				<h3>prehistory-1799</h3>
				<p>Nova Scotia was home to the Mi'kmaq nation when it was first settled by European colonists.  In 1605 French colonists founded the first permanent European settlement in Canada in the southern half of the Nova Scotian mainland, calling the region Acadia.  Acadia was subject to frequent warfare as Europeans fought Mi'kmaqs and the French fought the English, until the latter series of conflicts ceased when the British conquered the French in 1713.  The British renamed the region Nova Scotia, or New Scotland.  During the American Revolution, Nova Scotia residents debated whether to support the Crown or the revolution. They sided with Britain, maintaining their status as a British colony.</p>
				<h3>1800-1899</h3>
				<p>During this time period, Nova Scotia benefited from Britain's wars.  They profited by supplying ships and natural resources like lumber and coal.  It was also during this time that Nova Scotia joined with several other colonies to become the new Dominion of Canada.  Later these colonies, now called provinces, would become the nation of Canada.</p>
				<h3>1900-2000</h3>
				<p>Nova Scotia (and its capital Halifax in particular) experienced two major events in the early part of the 20th century, one of which is quite well known.  The first and more well-known event was was the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912.  While ships took survivors to New York City, other ships were dispatched from the nearest port, Halifax, Nova Scotia, to gather the dead and what wreckage was able to be savaged.  Several hundred Titanic dead are buried in cemeteries around the city.<br>
				<br>
				The second event is not as well known, but equally horrific.  On December 6, 1917, two ships, one of which was carrying explosives, collided.  The subsequent fire on the munitions ship created an explosion.  This explosion was the <strong>largest man-made explosion prior to the atomic bomb</strong>.  It killed thousands, injured thousands more, and leveled the city for miles around.  The force of the explosion (estimated to be the equivalent of about 2.9 kilotons of TNT) was felt hundreds of miles away.  The coroner found that his job of handling the dead was eased only because he had handled the dead from the Titanic five years prior.</p>

				<h3>Modern Nova Scotia</h3>
				<p>The coal mining industry died out in Nova Scotia during the new millennium as it was outsourced to other countries.  Much effort has been made lately to preserve culture, whether Mi'kmaq or Scottish or French Canadian.  Nova Scotia has seen a resurgence of people interested in learning Scottish Gaelic, some forms of which are only alive in Nova Scotia, having died out in Scotland long ago.  Cape Breton has become a beacon for tourists interested in its natural beauty and long folk music culture.</p>
